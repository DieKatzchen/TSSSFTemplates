Template Files for Making Your Own TSSSF Cards!

Hopefully there will be a great script out there soon that everypony can use to make all kinds of variations on this game with little more than the pull of a big, shiny code lever, but in the mean time, you can use our resources to build your own cards!

CONTENTS OF THIS ZIP:

card backs - This folder has the backs of cards.  If you are printing your own deck, you might want to use card sleves instead of the backs, like we did through much of our playtesting!  But if you want to have all the resources to print, glue and laminate your way to a sharp-looking deck, they're here.

symbols - All the symbols that show up in the corners of cards are here.

templates - These are PNGs of all four card types, including the START card in case you want to have Spike or Trixie or Celestia in charge of the board for example.  They have a hole punched in them in the alpha channel so you can easily slap them together in photoshop or gimp or whatever with your own artwork.

fonts - All the fonts we use are here!  LinLibertine is used for the flavortext.  Ubahn_newpony is a specialized variant on Ubahn that has the symbols for different pony-related icons replacing some characters:

8 - Unicorn
9 - Pegasus
% - Earth Pony
@ - Alicorn
\# - Goal
$ - Of Ponies and Peril
\* - Female
; - Male
< - Ship

Packard Antique Bold is used on the backs!
